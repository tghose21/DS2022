and could not tell where the stench was coming from so he searched the 
$NOUN2. While he was $VERB1, he tripped over a $ADJ2 rock. The rock had 
magical powers and started talking to the $NOUN1. The rock told the $NOUN1 
that he was cursed and in order to be a $ADJ1 $NOUN he had to cast a spell 
$ADV2. The $NOUN1 was scared and started $VERB2. He ended up waking up 
from his dream. This all happened $ADV1 and the $NOUN1 will never get past 
this event."
